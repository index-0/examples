gpio interrupt
==============
Demonstrates using GPIO interrupts to detect and report rising and falling
edge events on a pin.

Requires
--------
Nothing.

Setup
-----
A jumper wire is needed to connect board pin 3 (GPIO 19) to a GND pin.

Usage
-----
1. View UART0 output at 115200 baud via the USB CDC ACM port.
2. Momentarily connect and disconnect board pin 3 to a GND pin using the
   jumper wire.

Output
------
- Connecting pin 3 to GND (falling edge) turns the green LED ON and prints
  "gpio13: fall" to the terminal.

- Disconnecting pin 3 from GND (rising edge) turns the green LED OFF and
  prints "gpio13: rise" to the terminal.
